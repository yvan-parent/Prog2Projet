         if a variable x: &'a i32 is used as type &'b i32, then this requires that lifetimes 'a and
         'b are equal),
       - adding constraints required by function calls,
       - generating constraints corresponding to reborrows. More precisely, if we create a borrow
         of a place that dereferences  borrows, then the lifetime of the borrow we
         create should be shorter than the lifetimes of the borrows the place dereference.
         For example, if x: &'a &'b i32, and we create a borrow y = &**x of type &'c i32,
         then 'c should be shorter than 'a and 'b.

    SUGGESTION: use functions [typ_of_place], [fields_types_fresh] and [fn_prototype_fresh].
